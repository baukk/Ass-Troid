# Ass-Troid
## _Yet, Another Asteroid Shooting Game_

Ass-Troid  is a , beginner project I developed while learning Python and specifically, PyGame module.

- What's different?
- Nothinf Really, Just there's my friends' bobble heads appearing along with meteors
- ✨THAT'S ALL

## Gameplay

## Tech


I used the following tools and libraries while development of the game:

- [VS Code] - " _You know who I am!_"
- [Python] - Entire game has been programmed using python and its libraries
- [PyGame] - Heart of the Game, Used PyGame and its methods to work major of the parts.
- [sys] - Used this to exit the runtime window
- [Random] - Used this to generate random occurences of 


And of course Ass-Troid itself is open source with a public repository
 on GitHub.


## Installation

Ass-Troid requires Python and some of it modules to run.

Install the following moduled and run the main.py file.

PyGame,Random,sys,threading,time
```sh
pip install pygame
pip install Random
pip install sys
pip install threading
```

## Development

Want to contribute and make it a better game? Great!
Ass-Troid has some issues. A lot of them, infact.
I would love for you to contribute to it.
#### Issues I'd like some help with.
- The game currently cannot stop its runtime after collision, although I managed to Blit a game-over screen on top of it.
- I'd like to add a +100 to the score after destroying every meteor in the game. 

## Need the program for your school/college project?

### I've got your back, mate!
 - Install Python3
 - Install all the required modules, libriaries as stated above
 - Want to add Your friends or maybe actual meteors for the gameplay?
 Replace the image files in the  graphics folder.
 Change the name of the existing import (which has my friends' pictures) {line 75 -90} of main.py.
Voila!
